# -Mobile-prices

This project is based on the Mobile prices dataset taken from Kaggle, this dataset contains several factors among which we find the brand, size, weight, image quality, RAM, battery, etc. that interfere in the sales price of a Mobile. With this data set, I want to estimate a price range that indicates how high the price is in relation to the mentioned features. For these we will apply the logistic regression and KNeighbors Classifier models.
