## Mobile Price Analysis
Welcome to my Mobile Price Analysis project! In this exciting endeavour, we will delve into a captivating dataset to uncover patterns and relationships that will help us better understand what factors influence the prices of mobile phones. Have you ever wondered why some phones cost more than others? This project aims to answer that question!

## Why is This Interesting?
The mobile phone market is a constantly evolving and competitive field. Understanding the factors that affect mobile phone prices can be crucial for consumers, manufacturers, and retailers. Here are some reasons why this project is interesting:

# Informed Decision-Making:
Consumers can use this information to make more informed purchase decisions and find the phone that best suits their needs and budget.

# Business Strategy:
Mobile phone companies and manufacturers can leverage this analysis to fine-tune their pricing and product feature strategies.

# Machine Learning: 
This project implements machine learning models like logistic regression and KNeighbors Classifier to predict price ranges, showcasing how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems.

# What Are We Going to Do?
Our analytical journey includes:

# Data Exploration:
We will dive deep into the dataset to understand its features and relationships. You'll see engaging visualizations that depict feature distributions and correlations.

# Feature Engineering:
We'll prepare the data for use in machine learning models and see how feature engineering can significantly impact results.

# Model Training:
We will apply logistic regression and KNeighbors Classifier models to predict price ranges. We'll analyze their performance and see which one works better.

# Dimensional Reduction (PCA):
We'll explore the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) dimensional reduction technique to understand how it can affect our model's performance.
